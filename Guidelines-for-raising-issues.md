1. Basic guidelines are laid down in [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/authorjapps/zerocode/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for raising an issue or a feature request

1. But while raising an issue or a problem or an incident or a feature-request, please take care of the following points without which the `issue` might get rejected. The AC(Acceptance Criteria)s are:

2. **AC1**- You have captured relevant logs into the ticket e.g. a scenario's all step(s) output. 
> You can find the logs under "target/logs" in case you missed it from IDE console

3. **AC2**- Write down the steps you performed which led to this issue or incident you are reporting

4. **AC3**- Provide all steps to reproduce the issue - Best is to provide your configs(or code changes) and the scenario file(stripping out any business-sensitive information)

5. Clearly capture into the story/ticket what is actual-result and what is the expected-result
   + In case of a Feature request or a Tool request - Please provide enough details stepwise

6. If you are simply asking a question or want to clarify something, please explain the issue in terms of what you want to achieve or which business use-case you want to solve. Please explain this with clarity.

### Wrong way:
_Note here: There is no business scenario or usecase provided. This makes difficult to understand the scenario you are trying to automate._

As an automation tester

AC:

I want `$EQ/$NOT.EQ for non-numerics` to be supported by the framework

So that I can compare strings using `$NOT.EQ` and continue to do my automation work.

Business use-case example:

So let's say I create a Ticket object(e.g. a POST call). It gets assigned to an agent from a random pool of agents. 
The created entity then returns with the "agent_id" field. 

Next time I create a ticket(a new POST call), I don't know which agent will get assigned to it, 
but I want to be sure it was not the previous one.
```

AC means : Acceptance Criteria. If you have more ACs, mark them as AC1, AC2...
